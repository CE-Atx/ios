***So, where do we begin?***

**Preface**
Thereâ€™s a lot of small business owners in this world who are passionate about helping their clients achieve their health goals. 

We want to create a marketplace to connect and facilitate relationships between trainers and users in an accessible and inexpensive way.
Welcome to Livit. 

****Style****

Our overall design of the application was focused arround a color of wellness and fitness, we picked Poppins as being the primary type face of the application; which provided a unique and friendly user interface to the user. Our focus was to keep simplicty at the forefront

We attempted to keep the applications overview simple, in the purpose of not confusing our users and creating a user expirience like no other. Below we have a short video in which goes over the general flow of the application.
